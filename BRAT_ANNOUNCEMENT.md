# 🎉 Agile Board v0.7.2 - Beta Testing via BRAT

Hi Obsidian community! 👋

I'm excited to share **Agile Board v0.7.2** for beta testing via BRAT!

## 🚀 What is Agile Board?

Transform your markdown notes into **visual boards** with editable frames. Think Eisenhower matrix, SWOT analysis, or any custom layout - all while keeping your data in plain markdown.

## ✨ What's New in v0.7.2

This release builds on the **complete architectural overhaul** with a major BRAT improvement:

### 🎯 Major Feature: **Auto-Download Default Layouts**
- ✅ **Perfect BRAT compatibility** → No manual layout installation needed!
- ✅ **Smart detection** → Downloads missing layouts automatically  
- ✅ **Resilient fallback** → Creates basic Eisenhower layout if network fails
- ✅ **Zero user intervention** → Just install via BRAT and go!

### 🏗️ Previous Improvements (v0.7.1):
- **Enterprise-grade architecture** with SOLID principles
- **Strong TypeScript typing** with immutable data structures  
- **Functional error handling** with Result<T> patterns
- **Comprehensive JSDoc documentation** and lifecycle management

**Code quality**: 3,924+ lines of enterprise-grade TypeScript!

1. Install [BRAT plugin](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from community plugins
